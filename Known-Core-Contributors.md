This is a ever-changing list of known core contributors, where they can list their capabilities and whether they want to be pinged or not.

Please consider adding yourself to this list, to give the other team members and community contributors some hints.

I (@bene64) make the start, and hope, I won't be the only one on this list :wink: <!-- Second contributor: please delete this line, when you added yourself to the list -->

| Name | About me / tasks at F-Droid | Pinging via @ |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| @bene64 | I'm a new contributor, currently primarily helping out at [Data](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata). Generally I have some experience with GitLab CI (but not for the F-Droid scripts). | You can ping me, but for most tasks, I'm probably not the one who can help a lot. At the moment it can take some days until I react.|
