Get a sneak peek at our current work, and help us make it the best it can be: try F-Droid Nightly.  There are "nightly" builds of the standard F-Droid Android client app, as well as a test version of F-Droid "Basic".  They are built, signed, and released by GitLab CI using debug keys, so they are not release quality.

* To download and install the APK directly, find the newest version of the APK you want in this listing: <https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroidclient-nightly/-/tree/master/fdroid/repo>

* To install them on a device that already has F-Droid on it, you can scan or click this QR Code to add a new repo to get the nightly builds:

To learn about the whole nightly setup, there is documentation all about [publishing nightly builds](https://f-droid.org/docs/Publishing_Nightly_Builds/) with `fdroid nightly`.
