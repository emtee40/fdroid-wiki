F-Droid repos generally maintain support for old F-Droid releases for a long time.  That means that old F-Droid releases will continue to work for years.  That provides a path to run F-Droid on very old Android releases.  Here are the download links for installing the newest release that runs on a given Android release:

* Android 4.0 (`14`) to Android 5.0 (`21`): <br/> https://f-droid.org/archive/org.fdroid.fdroid_1012051.apk 
* Android 2.3.3 (`10`) to Android 3.x (`13`): <br/> https://f-droid.org/archive/org.fdroid.fdroid_1002052.apk 
* Android 2.2 (`8`) to Android 2.3 (`9`): <br/> https://f-droid.org/archive/org.fdroid.fdroid_100150.apk

Please note that many apps on F-Droid may no longer support such old Android versions. It is recommended to enable the "F-Droid Archive" repository in the F-Droid app. Enabling the archive lets F-Droid show you older versions of apps, which may include versions that still work on your device.
