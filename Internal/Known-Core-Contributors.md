| Name | About me / tasks at F-Droid | Pinging via @ |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| @bene64 | I'm a new contributor, currently primarily helping out at [Data](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata). Generally I have some experience with GitLab CI (but not for the F-Droid scripts). | You can ping me, but for most tasks, I'm probably not the one who can help a lot. At the moment it can take some days until I react.|
| @fossdd |I mainly work on the [RFPs](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/rfp/-/issues). Also response on the Issues/MRs on [_fdroiddata_](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata). And help with anything that comes up. | You can ping me on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/fossdd), mention me on the [fediverse](https://chaos.social/@fossdd), or write me on [matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@fossdd:matrix.org). I usually respond after some hours. |
