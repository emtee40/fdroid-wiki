With our migration to Mailcow, we now also have a team calendar.

# Subscribing
## DAVx5
Press `+`, then use `Advanced login (special use cases)`.

For `Base URL`, enter `https://hosted.mailcow.de/SOGo/dav/calendar@f-droid.org/Calendar/personal/`. Check username/password and enter your full F-Droid email address and password.

## Mailcow SoGo
Go to Calendars, press `+` on Subscriptions and enter calendar@f-droid.org.

## Mozilla Thunderbird
Go to Calendar, press `+`.

In Create New Calendar, choose "On the Network".

For username, enter your full F-Droid email address and for Location enter `https://hosted.mailcow.de/SOGo/dav/calendar@f-droid.org/Calendar/personal/`.

After pressing Find Calendars, Thunderbird will ask you for your F-Droid email password.

## Gnome Evolution
Open the calendar view, right-click on one of the items in the left pane and choose "New calendar". Select "CalDAV" as type. In the URL input, paste `https://hosted.mailcow.de/SOGo/dav/calendar@f-droid.org/Calendar/personal/` and as User specify your `@f-droid.org` address. Optionally specify an email address for invitations.

As you cannot add to the teams calendar directly, you might need to repeat this for your own `@f-droid.org` calendar which you can keep "invisible" (to not see all self-created appointments twice).

# Adding entries
To add an entry to the Team calendar, simply add something to your personal calendar and invite calendar@f-droid.org. All subscribed members will see the calendar event.
